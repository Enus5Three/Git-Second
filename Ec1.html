             Three butterflies lived in a garden. They were friend. 
             One of them was white, one red and the other yellow.  
             They played and danced together. 
             They flew together and sucked nectar from the flowers . 
             One afternoon, when the butterflies were playing in the garden, 
             it suddenly grew dark and a cold Wind blew.
